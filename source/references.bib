  abstract = {Mobile devices and their applications have become integral in our daily lives, with people spending an average of 3 hours and 15 minutes on their phones each day. The growth in mobile applications has increased the number of interfaces that users interact with, making usability and user satisfaction crucial for their success. This paper aims to compare two usability testing methods, user observation and UMUX post-test questionnaire, in real usability testing sessions with various applications. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in measuring user satisfaction and determining the usability of mobile interfaces. Furthermore, since it was noticed that the results from these two methods are conflicting, we have developed a proposal for a usability questionnaire for mobile applications, so that it can be tested in the future.},

This article considers the total equipment effectiveness and Kaizen is applied for the interruptions with negative impacts on productivity. The productivity of the company is significantly increased after the Kaizen application. In order to digitalize the manufacturing processes successfully, more expert opinions are required. The Bayesian network (BN) is used to achieve higher increase at productivity. It has a powerful probability theory eliminating the inconsistent probability. During the implementation phase, the most important part of this article is the employment of components of the total equipment effectiveness as the variable for BN. The utilizing the expert opinions resulted to advance productivity. At the end of the Kaizen study, the productivity is raised from 83\% to 85\%.

This paper provides a performance and availability-related analysis of three modern API design techniques, namely Representational State Transfer, Google‚Äôs Remote Procedure Call Framework, and Apache Thrift to practically show which of these techniques should be used in the implementation of the API Gateways for performance and availability considering that the gateways undertake a crucial role as they are the backbone of communication in Microservices Architecture and the performance and availability are two critical factors that determine how well API gateways can perform. For our analysis, an API Gateway prototype for each of the three API design techniques was developed by using Microsoft‚Äôs .NET framework, and load-tests against each of these three prototypes were performed and analyzed. The results of this paper are expected to be helpful for both researchers and practitioners in the software industry who need to choose from different industrial API design techniques for API Gateway development.},

  abstract = {The process of developing a mobile application typically starts with the ideation and conceptualization of its user interface. This concept is then translated into a set of mock-ups to help determine how well the user interface embodies the intended features of the app. After the creation of mock-ups developers then translate it into an app that runs in a mobile device. In this paper we propose an approach, called GUIGLE, that aims to facilitate the process of conceptualizing the user interface of an app through GUI search. GUIGLE indexes GUI images and metadata extracted using automated dynamic analysis on a large corpora of apps extracted from Google Play. To perform a search, our approach uses information from text displayed on a screen, user interface components, the app name, and screen color palettes to retrieve relevant screens given a query. Furthermore, we provide a lightweight query language that allows for intuitive search of screens. We evaluate GUIGLE with real users and found that, on average, 68.8\% of returned screens were relevant to the specified query. Additionally, users found the various different features of GUIGLE useful, indicating that our search engine provides an intuitive user experience. Finally, users agree that the information presented by GUIGLE is useful in conceptualizing the design of new screens for applications. Video URL: https://youtu.be/hqUuuMMj2BU.},

However, finding such design examples is challenging, especially as current search systems rely on only text-based queries and do not consider the UI structure and content into account. This paper introduces VINS, a visual search framework, that takes as input a UI image (wireframe, high-fidelity) and retrieves visually similar design examples. We first survey interface designers to better understand their example finding process. We then develop a large-scale UI dataset that provides an accurate specification of the interface‚Äôs view hierarchy (i.e., all the UI components and their specific location). By utilizing this dataset, we propose an object-detection based image retrieval framework that models the UI context and hierarchical structure. The framework achieves a mean Average Precision of 76.39\% for the UI detection and high performance in querying similar UI designs.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that mobile search is becoming an increasingly important way for mobile users to gain access to online information, especially as off-portal content continues to grow rapidly. In this paper we study the characteristics of mobile search by analysing approximately 6 million individual search requests generated by over 260,000 individual mobile searchers over a 7-day period during 2006. We analyse the patterns of queries used by mobile searchers and focus on key characteristics such as the clickthru rates of mobile searches in order to understand, for the first time, just how well mobile search engines are responding to user queries. Moreover, we compare our results to a number of recent mobile studies and highlight some of the key differences between mobile search and traditional Web search behaviours.},

Limited screenspace, restricted text-input and interactivity, and impatient users all conspire to exacerbate the shortcomings of modern Web search. Recently researchers have proposed that typically vague search queries be augmented by context information, as a way to help search engines to retrieve more relevant information. In this paper we propose a novel interface to support multi-dimensional, context-sensitive mobile search, combining context features such as location, time, and community preferences to offer a unique search experience that is well-adapted to the needs of mobile users.},

  abstract = {Query-based searching and browsing-based navigation are the two main components of exploratory search. Search lets users dig in deep by controlling their actions to focus on and find just the information they need, whereas navigation helps them to get an overview to decide which content is most important. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "search powered navigation" and investigate the effect of empowering navigation with search functionality on information seeking behavior of users and their experience by conducting a user study on exploratory search tasks, differentiated by different types of information needs. Our main findings are as follows: First, we observe radically different search tactics. Using search, users are able to control and augment their search focus, hence they explore the data in a depth-first, bottom-up manner. Conversely, using pure navigation they tend to check different options to be able to decide on their path into the data, which corresponds to a breadth-first, top-down exploration. Second, we observe a general natural tendency to combine aspects of search and navigation, however, our experiments show that the search functionality is essential to solve exploratory search tasks that require finding documents related to a narrow domain. Third, we observe a natural need for search powered navigation: users using a system without search functionality find creative ways to mimic searching using navigation.},

  abstract = {The study of the impact of modern technologies and, in particular, digitalization on the transformation and future development of industries, as well as changes in economic models both within the industry itself and at the level of one state, and in interstate economic relations, is one of the new areas of research in the global economy originating from the very nascent phenomenon. The object of this study is the automotive industry. However, the changing processes presented in this article affect many other industries. Digitalization will require not only new strategies from manufacturers trying to gain competitive advantages, but also a state that is responding to new reality to protect personal data and personal space of citizens. In this sample-structured document, neither the cross-linking of float elements and bibliography nor metadata/copyright information is available. The sample document is provided in ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù mode and to view it in the final layout format, applying the required template is essential with some standard steps. These steps, which should require generation of the final output from the styled paper, are mentioned here in this paragraph. First, users have to run ‚ÄúReference Numbering‚Äù from the ‚ÄúReference Elements‚Äù menu; this is the first step to start the bibliography marking (it should be clicked while keeping the cursor at the beginning of the reference list). After the marking is complete, the reference element runs all the options under the ‚ÄúCross Linking‚Äù menu. The authors base their research on consistent patterns characterizing the dependence of industrial development on the general economic situation. To analyze the processes occurring in industries under the influence of new technologies, a comparative analysis of the research materials of international research companies, world economic communities and advanced technological auto giants is carried out. The approaches used in the research include a prognostic analysis of the behavior of market entities under the influence of new digital technologies. Digital transformation is changing the traditional business model and value chain. The emerging trends are personalization of services and individual customer interaction solutions: Omnichannel pre-sales engagement, customized driving experience, targeted mobility, IoT integration, car dealerships, personalized insurance, personalized data insurance, car sharing customer profiles, etc. As the industry moves from the simple production of an automobile to the creation of an intelligent, connected digital transport hub, companies need to adapt to the value chain and life cycle of the client, not the car. Connected cars will be a continuation and expression of the individuality and style of the client, like the revolution of mobile phones. Digital transformation in the automotive industry will bring positive transformations for both consumers and society as a whole, affecting the environment at the same time and creating new jobs, which, of course, should attract attention and be supported by the state as a regulatory body.},

  abstract = {Objective Driven trough the new paradigm of application development for mobile devices, customers expect to have a device that can be updated with the latest and greatest features. Many useful applications have emerged from the existing ecosystem of SDKs, App Stores, etc. These applications are accessible anywhere, anytime, based on proper data connection. In the context of cars, one should be able to use apps without touching the mobile device. Cars offer a comprehensive infrastructure of control elements and screens optimized for usage whilst driving. Cars also offer a large amount of context knowledge from its sensor system. Leveraging the additional computing power and data connection of mobile devices in combination with the car enables a complete new level of features. Methodology An abstract interface between the car and the mobile device is implemented. The application itself is running on the mobile device and dynamically creates new features in the car. It is seamlessly integrated into the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system, which displays its features on the car screen. The application is controlled by the car interaction elements. By using this abstract interface the application on the mobile device has access to the sensor system and the audio system of the car. To avoid driver distraction guidelines and review procedures have been established. This is why applications can only connect to vehicles with proper authentication credentials. Results The IVI interface solves the objectives by offering (1) a ‚ÄúRemote HMI‚Äù interface that allows external applications to create their own HMI represented on the car display. User interaction is transferred to an external application through a notification service. (2) a ‚ÄúCar Data Server‚Äù interface sending vehicle sensor data to the mobile device. (3) an ‚ÄúAudio Service‚Äù playing audio in the car. Based on these technologies, new features such as MINIMALISM Analyser (a trainer for efficient driving) or Driving Excitement (a dynamic display of driving data, e.g. lateral/longitudinal acceleration, torque) are being developed. Furthermore, integrated versions of existing applications, e.g. music services like Pandora and MOG have been released. The IVI extension was introduced as an option for BMW Group vehicles in August 2010 (MINI)/March 2011 (BMW). At present, this option is compatible with the Apple iOS platform.},

This paper presents the results of experimentally testing a new method for extracting functional analogies from general data sources, such as patent databases, to assist designers in systematically seeking and identifying analogies. In summary, the approach produces significantly improved results on the novelty of solutions generated and no significant change in the total quantity of solutions generated. Computationally, this design-by-analogy facilitation methodology uses a novel functional vector space representation to quantify the functional similarity between represented design problems and, in this case, patent descriptions of products. The mapping of the patents into the functional analogous words enables the generation of functionally relevant novel ideas that can be customized in various ways. Overall, this approach provides functionally relevant novel sources of design-by-analogy inspiration to designers and design teams.},

  abstract = {Mobile search is becoming increasingly important for mobile users as mobile devices are more widely used. Mobile search is quite different from standard PC-based web search in a number of ways: (a) the user interfaces and I/O are limited by screen real estate, (b) key pads are tiny and inconvenient for use, (c) limited bandwidth and (d) costly connection fees. These limitations result in more navigational queries in the mobile search. Furthermore, user location, activities, preferences, and interaction history can also improve accuracy in determining relevance for mobile search. In the past, most personalized search algorithms are studied in the context of PC-based web search. Personalized mobile search should however play a bigger role at improving the user experiences. This paper focuses on the personalization strategies which explicitly and implicitly infer user search context at individual user level. We propose an architecture which collects user information (at mobile device and carrier network) and derives user intention in given situations. We show that personalized mobile search perform well for ambiguous queries and localized searches.},

We do this by revealing a random sample of the adversarial input to the online player ahead of time. The online player competes with the expected optimal value on the part of the input that arrives online. Our model bridges between existing online stochastic models (e.g., items are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution) and the online worst-case model. We also extend in a similar manner (by revealing a sample) the online random-order model.We study the classical secretary problem in our new models. In the worst-case model we present a simple online algorithm with optimal competitive-ratio for any sample size. In the random-order model, we also give a simple online algorithm with an almost tight competitive-ratio for small sample sizes. Interestingly, we prove that for a large enough sample, no algorithm can be simultaneously optimal both in the worst-cast and random-order models.},

However, the physical restrictions of mobile devices such as display size and input capabilities and the changes of users' contexts may affect the users' information needs and search behaviors. In order to design a new search service which takes mobile users' situation into consideration, it is essential to understand search behaviors of mobile users in detail. In this work, we conducted a diary study using 26 participants in Japan, focusing on how mobile context affects users' information needs and search behaviors. In particular, we focus on detailed behaviors when users failed to find the information they needed. Our main findings include that user's search behaviors were affected not only by the information needs but also the place where the searches were conducted, which might be an important cue to design future mobile search services and applications.},

When a user takes a photo, the system extracts its meta-data of date/time and GPS as well as its various annotations automatically (e.g., mailing address, place names, event names, weather, etc.). Based on the annotations, we implemented a keyword search function over photos in smartphones. With this system, users can easily search photos with keyword conditions, even though they don't give any additional information.},

As of today, the markets for such devices feature over 850K+ apps for Android and 900K+ for iOS. Availability, cost, functionality, and usability are just some factors that determine the success or lack of success for a given app. Among the other factors, reliability is an important criteria: users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, abandoning some apps in favor of others.  This paper reports a study analyzing how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by 7,097 (free) Android apps relates to applications' lack of success, estimated from user ratings. Results of this study provide important insights into a crucial issue: making heavy use of fault- and change-prone APIs can negatively impact the success of these apps.},

  abstract = {The popularity of smartphones and tablet computers in recent years makes mobile apps burst. Mobile apps have become the main consumers of the Internet-based services. Compared to traditional applications in the desktop computing era, mobile devices with their apps bring new opportunities and challenges to service computing community, in various aspects like service publication, discovery, interaction, composition, et al. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven, content-based mobile apps composition approach, called Mash Droid, by leveraging a novel In-App Search mechanism, i.e., Discovering relevant services for the data and content in apps. Rather than existing techniques that usually integrate fixed Web services, our approach relies on the dynamic service discovery and flexible data exchange between several apps. The unique feature of our approach is enabling the data communication channel between apps by the content index services provided by a leading Android appstore, Wandoujia, which now has over 1,000,000 apps and 200 million users. We employ the In-App Search mechanism to define a Restful-style app model and resource-oriented app description model. Based on the models, we design a framework for dynamically discovering relevant apps that could be composed with current app's contexts. We implement a prototype to demonstrate our approach.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of the huge number of mobile applications (apps) and their increasing growth rate, how to appropriately search, recommend, and manage apps is becoming a critical challenge to enhance the usage of mobile apps for users. Although existing mobile app search engines provide basic search functionalities to let users find relevant mobile apps by issuing query keywords, however, the ranking of search results cannot fully satisfy user's expectations. Besides, personal app management mechanism is required for enhancing the usage of apps, but such mechanisms are lacking. Therefore, we propose an approach, called Tag-based and QoS-aware Mobile Application Search and Management (TQMASM), to address above issues. TQMASM mainly provides two functionalities: (1) QoS-aware app search and tag-based app recommendation; and (2) tag-based app management. QoS-aware app search is an objective ranking method for sorting app search results by considering the proposed QoS factors, popularity and reputation. Tag-based app recommendation is an app retrieval approach to find apps according to tags annotated by all users. Tag-based app management utilizes the hierarchical app tree and tag annotation to ease the management and the usage for interested apps. A prototype that realized TQMASM is also developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Technology has impacted businesses in different areas, and, consequently, many companies have found it necessary to make changes in their structures and business models to improve customer satisfaction. The objective was to quantify the effect of dynamic capabilities on customer satisfaction, through digital transformation within the automotive sector. A random sample of 42 questionnaires on 127 surveyed industries was collected during the period 2019‚Äì2020 in a pre-COVID-19 context. A structural equation model (SEM) in two stages was applied. In the first stage, two reflective models were built. In a second stage, a structural equation model was evaluated. The results obtained in this study showed that the capabilities of sensing, seizing and innovation were suitably grouped in a construct called ‚ÄúDynamic Capabilities‚Äù. A positive influence of Dynamic Capabilities on customer satisfaction was found. Therefore, the companies in this industry should focus on developing dynamic capabilities to improve customer satisfaction. Once the opportunities have been identified, managers take advantage of their potential (seizing) to transform and exploit knowledge in the creation, innovation, process improvement, and definition of strategies to combine new knowledge with that already existing. The digital transformation has contributed to identify the real needs for customers, to contact them and solve their problems, as well as offering products and services by anticipating their needs.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents a field with a huge innovation potential for the automotive industry, apps for connected cars. Section 7.1 reports on the current situation of the global automotive and IT market and its management and systems. In this regard, the focus in Sect. 7.2 refers to the actual trend on agile software development in the automotive industry. Agile software development places a strong focus on fast response to customer requirements, turning speed and agility into a key competitive advantage whereby the Agile Manifesto laid out the underlying concepts of agile development. In Sect. 7.3 the importance of smartphones and the corresponding app market is introduced as well as their unprecedented growth in numbers. This raises the question for their usage in vehicles. Therefore, Sect. 7.4 focuses on the iOS operating system which offers a rich set of features and a powerful application programming interface (API) for mobile app development and is fully integrated with Apple‚Äôs iCloud ecosystem. Henceforth, Sect. 7.5 launches the background of Xcode, an integrated development environment (IDE) for developers which allows multi-language and multi-target platform development for native macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications. The supported languages are Apple‚Äôs Objective-C and Swift with the Cocoa framework, but it is also possible to develop C and C++ applications. Section 7.6 introduces into Android applications which are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit. Android is a powerful operating system competing neck-to-neck with Apple‚Äôs iOS. Section 7.7 focuses on the topic how car manufactures are embracing the smartphone technologies by integrating Apple‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs hardware and software into the car‚Äôs infotainment system. Apple‚Äôs technology is called CarPlay, Google‚Äôs Android Car. In Sect. 7.8 the required programming languages for mobility app development such as Objective-C, Swift, and Java App Development are introduced. Moreover, Sect. 7.9 introduces the requirements of the use case example of the car ride-sharing models carpooling and cab sharing. Wrapping up, in Sect. 7.10 the source code of some of the key classes in the several applications is discussed. Finally, in Sect. 7.11 exercises are included in a form of a questionnaire to be answered. The last section is followed by references and suggestions for further reading.},

  abstract = {At this time, mobile devices have an important role because it provides changes for users. Not only making calls, but many features and applications are used to make work easier. Mobile application development brings new challenges to mobile devices, such as usability context when users use mobile applications. Usability is an important factor in mobile applications' role in making them easy to use and efficient. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) has a critical role in software development. It has a function that is one of the keys to the effectiveness of using the software. This study aims to find popular usability evaluation on mobile applications with the help of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The usability evaluation process of mobile applications is carried out with a systematic literature review of 22 papers. The results show that 73\% of the methods used are usability testing, 23\% heuristic evaluations, and 4\% are user satisfaction usability evaluations. To conduct usability evaluation on mobile applications, usability testing is carried out in five stages, involves participants, and has the characteristics of Effectiveness, Efficiency, and User Satisfaction. Meanwhile, in heuristic evaluation, experts must be involved in evaluating the user interfaces. This study proposes a mixed method of usability testing and heuristic evaluation in conducting usability evaluation on mobile applications. This method is expected to provide effective and objective usability issues from the perspective of users and experts in improving User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).},

  abstract = {With the spread of the internet as social infrastructure, more and more people are shopping online. Online sites that formerly dealt with such specific products as books and clothing have also expanded to mall-type shopping sites by incorporating various kinds of stores. As a result, searching for products has become more complicated and prolonged. In this paper, we propose a method that models product-searching behavior based on the transition of the search words input by users. Since a query is generally composed of one or more search words, their information content is calculated in advance from query logs. Thus, varying the information content of the user's query sequences can be classified as a model of user searching behaviors. From analysis results using actual data, we confirmed that our proposed method effectively models product-searching behavior.},

  abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous. People take pictures via their phone cameras to explore the world on the go. In many cases, they are concerned with the picture-related information. Understanding user intent conveyed by those pictures therefore becomes important. Existing mobile applications employ visual search to connect the captured picture with the physical world. However, they only achieve limited success due to the ambiguity nature of user intent in the picture-one picture usually contains multiple objects. By taking advantage of multitouch interactions on mobile devices, this paper presents a prototype of interactive mobile visual search, named TapTell, to help users formulate their visual intent more conveniently. This kind of search leverages limited yet natural user interactions on the phone to achieve more effective visual search while maintaining a satisfying user experience. We make three contributions in this work. First, we conduct a focus study on the usage patterns and concerned factors for mobile visual search, which in turn leads to the interactive design of expressing visual intent by gesture. Second, we introduce four modes of gesture-based interactions (crop, line, lasso, and tap) and develop a mobile prototype. Third, we perform an in-depth usability evaluation on these different modes, which demonstrates the advantage of interactions and shows that lasso is the most natural and effective interaction mode. We show that TapTell provides a natural user experience to use phone camera and gesture to explore the world. Based on the observation and conclusion, we also suggest some design principles for interactive mobile visual search in the future.},

  abstract = {Cross-platform mobile application development is the pressing priority in today‚Äôs world and generation. Developers are enforced to either construct the same application numerous times for various OS (operating systems) or accept a low-quality similar solution that trades native speed and accuracy for portability. Flutter is an open-source SDK for developing high-performance and more reliable mobile applications for operating systems like iOS and Android. Significant features of the Flutter are Just-in-time compilation which executes the computer code that encompasses compiling during program execution at run time rather than preceding execution. More frequently, this comprises of bytecode translation lesserknown as source code to machine code, which is unswervingly executed. AOT compilation (Ahead-of-time compilation) compiles a high-level programming language such as C or C++, or an intermediary representation such as Java bytecode or NET Framework Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code, into native system-dependent machine code so that the subsequent binary file can execute natively. Flutter has a feature called as hot reload which helps you easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs. Hot reload works by inserting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine (VM). After the VM updates classes with the new versions of fields and functions, the Flutter framework automatically reconstructs the widget tree, permitting you to rapidly view the special effects of your changes. Flutter targets the top mobile operating systems like Android and iOS, it gives you a solution for GPU rendering and UI, powered by native ARM code.},

  abstract = {Web services are widely used as basic constructs to build complex distributed applications with fast speed and low cost. However, existing service discovery techniques provide users with poor results which require substantial human intervention to filter the services to locate the desired ones. In particular, users often have no prior knowledge of the functional description of the available services on the Web. The queries formulated by the users may not match well with the service descriptions of existing services. As a consequence, a user's query can result in a large number of returned services. In this paper, we propose an approach that derives the semantic concepts conveyed in the service descriptions and clusters the services based on the concepts. As a result, each concept is associated with a set of relevant services. To understand the semantic meanings of a user's query, we identify concepts behind the query and recommend related concepts associated with services. Our approach also guides users to formulate their queries. We conducted a case study and found that the average precision and recall of our approach for service discovery are respectively, 83\% and 100\%. We also performed a user study which shows that for 85\% of time, a user reformulates their queries using the suggestion provided by our approach to improve the precision of the retrieved services.},

Nowadays, we can do scientific articles searching by accessing available general search engines or search engines specific for scientific article domain. In this paper, we present a User Experience (UX) study of an existing scientific article search engine and propose an improved design based on users feedback. The respondents of this study are 30 final year undergraduate students majoring in computer science. The UX study on the existing scientific article search engine using System Usability Scale (SUS) score revealed that the website need improvement, given the low SUS score, 24. We improved the website design by implementing User Centered Design approach, and the SUS score increase to 80.6.},

  abstract = {Release planning for mobile apps has recently become an area of active research. Prior research in this area concentrated on the analysis of release notes and on tracking user reviews to support app evolution with issue trackers. However, little is known about the impact of user reviews on the evolution of mobile apps. Our work explores the role of user reviews in app updates based on release notes. For this purpose, we collected user reviews and release notes of Spotify, the ﬂ¢number one‚Äô app in the ‚ÄòMusic‚Äô category in Apple App Store, as the research data. Then, we manually removed non-informative parts of each release note, and manually determined the relevance of the app reviews with respect to the release notes. We did this by using Word2Vec calculation techniques based on the top 80 app release notes with the highest similarities. Our empirical results show that more than 60 \% of the matched reviews are actually irrelevant to the corresponding release notes. When zooming in at these relevant user reviews, we found that around half of them were posted before the new release and referred to requests, suggestions, and complaints. Whereas, the other half of the relevant user reviews were posted after updating the apps and concentrated more on bug reports and praise.},

  abstract = {Since the release of the first mobile devices, the usability of on-board applications has been the concern not only of software vendors but hardware manufacturers as well. The academia community later willingly joined the discussion on usability in terms of theory and empirical measurement, having experience and knowledge in desktop settings. At first sight, such a background should guarantee a solid foundation to conduct research on software usability in a new setting. However, a preliminary study on the subject matter revealed methodological disorder in contemporary literature. As a matter of fact, a need emerged to review existing usability definitions, attributes and measures to recognize all associated aspects. In order to fill this void, we conducted a systematic literature review on usability studies indexed by the Scopus database and devoted to mobile applications. The input volume covers 790 documents from 2001 to 2018. The data analysis shows that the ISO 9241-11 usability definition has been adopted in an unchanged form and popularized as the standard by the HCI community. Secondly, in total, 75 attributes were identified and analysed. The most frequent are efficiency (70\%), satisfaction (66\%) and effectiveness (58\%), which directly originate from the above definition. Subsequently, the less frequent are learnability (45\%), memorability (23\%), cognitive load (19\%) and errors (17\%). The last two concern simplicity (13\%) and ease of use (9\%). Thirdly, in the evaluation of usability, controlled observation and surveys are two major research methods applied, while eye-tracking, thinking aloud and interview are hardly used and serve as complementary to collect additional data. Moreover, usability evaluations are often confused with user experience dimensions, covering not only application quality characteristics, but also user beliefs, emotions and preferences. All these results indicate the need for further research on the usability of mobile applications, aiming to establish a consensus in the theory and practice among all interested parties.},

Internet search is likely going to remain one of the major ways to find information and services on the web. In order to provide satisfactory usability, mobile searches will have to take into consideration the nature of handsets. Being both pervasive and person-centric they continuously capture information about users and their context. Context awareness can enhance the mobile search experience by augmenting user queries with context information captured through the handset's sensors. In this paper we propose a unified architecture supporting context-awareness in mobility and show how it can be applied to mobile searches. Based on real life contextual data captured from handsets we discuss design approaches and end-user benefits of making mobile searches more context-aware.},

Guided by the user‚Äôs interactive needs, this paper aims to improve the visual search efficiency of mobile map navigation icons. The mixed design within and between subjects is adopted through the combination of theoretical and experimental research, and the subjective questionnaire method is used to explore the research. This paper explores the visual search problem of mobile map navigation icons based on color coding and layout coding. The experimental results mainly include reaction time, accuracy rate, user experience, and statistical and variance analysis. The results show that the layout of the mobile map navigation icons significantly impacts the user‚Äôs visual search. The navigation icons that use color for layout coding have the highest visual search efficiency and better user experience. Among the icons, the layout with regular color distribution and a larger area of the same color has the highest visual search efficiency for users and the best user experience; the visual search efficiency of navigation icons using color for layout coding is significantly higher than that of mobile map navigation icons.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$><$}bold{$>$}Relevance to industry:{$<$}/bold{$>$} The user scale of mobile information maps is huge and the usage rate is high, but the large number of navigation icons increases the burden of user information identification and acquisition. As a result, the efficiency of user information acquisition is low, and the user experience is reduced. A clear, easy-to-search navigation icon design can enhance the user experience of the entire product. The results of this research provide theoretical support and practical guidance for the design optimization and improvement of mobile map navigation icons.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Resources in cloud computing platforms such as Amazon, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure are a natural fit to remedy the lack of local resources in mobile devices, which creates a new space of mobile search to improve the availability of cloud resources. In essence, mobile search is a context-aware and personalized activity since mobile devices' inherent movability allows people to retrieve information anytime and anywhere. However, current mobile search products are always far from personalized and are accuracy centered on the convergence of mobile platforms. In this paper, a hybrid filtering mechanism is proposed to eliminate irrelevant or less relevant results for personalized mobile search, which combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The former filters the results according to the mobile user's feature model generated from the user's query history, and the latter filters the results using the user's social network, which is constructed from the user's communication history. Experiments show that the filtering mechanism can significantly improve the user's personalized and precise searching experience on mobile phones.},
